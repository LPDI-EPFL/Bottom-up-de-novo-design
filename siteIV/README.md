# Design of three topologies to stabilize the irregular site IV epitope 

Using TopoBuilder, we built three different topologies - [3E2H](./3E2H),[4E1H](./4E1H) and [4E2H](./4E2H) to showcase the applicability of Topobuilder to enumerate the novel protein folds for an accommmodation of RSVF site IV epitope, which consists of 6-residues with an irregular b structure.  

These topologies differ in their secondary structural composition as well as in the exact arrangment of the secondary structures. Importantly, the defined topologies can be described as string representation to enumerate all the possible protein architectures with the topology. Therefore, for the purpose of motif stabilization, the optimal protein architectures are chosen, based on the user definition.  

For details on the designs and the TopoBuilder configuration files, please go to [3E2H](./3E2H),[4E1H](./4E1H) and [4E2H](./4E2H).
