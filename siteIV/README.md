# Design of three topologies to stabilize the irregular site IV epitope 

Using TopoBuilder, we built three different topologies that accommodate the RSVF antigenic site IV epitope, an irregular, 6 residue beta strand. The topologies were named according to their secondary structure content (E - strand, H - helix) - [3E2H](./3E2H),[4E1H](./4E1H) and [4E2H](./4E2H). The designed topologies differ in their secondary structural composition as well as in their spatial positioning. Together, this illustrates the applicability of the Topobuilder to build a variety of protein folds that accommodate a given functional motif. For details on the designs and the TopoBuilder configuration files, please go to [3E2H](./3E2H),[4E1H](./4E1H) and [4E2H](./4E2H).
