# Design of two different helical topologies to stabilize the discontinuous site 0 epitope

Using TopoBuilder, we built two different topologies - [3H1L_01](./3H1L_01) and [3H1L_02](./3H1L_02). 

They differ in their connectivity as well as in the exact placement of the helical secondary structures (see json configuration files). Of note,
