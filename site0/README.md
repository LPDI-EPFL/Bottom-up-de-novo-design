# Design of two different helical topologies to stabilize the discontinuous site 0 epitope

Using TopoBuilder, we built two different topologies - [3H1L_01](./3H1L_01) and [3H1L_02](./3H1L_02) to accommmodate the RSVF site 0 epitope. The site 0 epitope consists of two segments, a 17-residue helical and a disordered 7-residue loop segment. 

The two topologies differ in their connectivity as well as in the exact placement of the helical secondary structures (see json configuration files). Importantly, the order of the two segments of site 0 are different in the two topologies - while  the site 0 helical segment is placed at the C terminus of the 3H1L_01 design series, the same segment is at the N terminus of 3H1L_02.

For details on the designs and the TopoBuilder configuration files, please go to [3H1L_01](./3H1L_01) and [3H1L_02](./3H1L_02).
