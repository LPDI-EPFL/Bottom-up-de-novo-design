## Description
This repository contains json-format files to organize the secondary structural composition, functional motif and spatial arrangement of each designed topology in a defined layer. And using the python-based algorithm TopoBuilder, it builds the ideal secondary structural elements (SSEs) with embeded motif in a 3D space. Based on the distance between the edge of each SSEs, the length of loop connection was automatically determined 
## Software prerequisites
## Method overview

This repository contains all computational protein design data related to the manuscript "A bottom-up approach for the de novo design of functional proteins".
