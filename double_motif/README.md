# Assembly of a dual motif scaffold accommodating RSVF site II and RSVG 2D10 epitope
To showcase the ability of assembling a topology de novo tailored to fit two distinct binding motifs, we built a 4H topology with the RSVF site II and RSVG 2D10 motif (PDB codes 3IXT and XXX, respectively). 

It is important to note that while each motif was relatively frequently found in the natural protein repertoire, the number of proteins available in the natural protein repertoire that can simultaneously accommodate both motifs was extremely limited.
